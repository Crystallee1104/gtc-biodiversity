# Zoom Meeting Notes from Friday 11th December

## Purpose

Biggest hands on data challenge hackathon during CDT program.

Need partners with hackathon due to expertise.


## Partners

Nicolas Longepe
 - Use our data from Copernicus (Sentinal 1, Sentinal 2)
 - Super resolution etc.

Marc Paganini (ESA)
 - Lots of knowledge over many years for AI4EO biodiversity.
 - European Commision biodiversity work (Brexit LOL) apparently we're not banned.
 - Bringing digital technologies into the solution (not just AI)
 - Digital twins project mainly focussed on AI. Biodiversity will likely be a component.
 - Designing a new agenda with the commision
 

Cooper Elsworth (Descartes Labs)
 - Start up in US focused on remote sensor data platform (data fusion, computer vision etc.)
 - Use different remote data sets, bring them together.
 - Big project on deforrestaion. With companies, trying to check their supply changes.
   - Old growth trees worse?
   - Where is it relevant.
 
Luca (WCMC UNEP)
 - Main focus is biodiversity, protecting it around the globe.
 - May have important projects that can be linked to this challenge.
 - Output may be useful for them.

Tom Dowling (WCMC UNEP)
 - Just joined WCMC UNEP, to integrate remote sensors into workflows and advance them.
 - We need AI4EO. Innovative products, and fusion products.
 - Build tools for our organistion.
   - Flexibility.
   - Interoperability.
 - Write tools in `Python3`, beware of overtraining.
 
Andrew Fleming (BAS)
 - Centre of proposal 6 months ago.
 - Providing lectures.
 - Lots of jargon from AI4EO.
 - Training material, help with physical resources, over and above SE, SO etc.

Anita Faul (BAS)
 - Make sure that everyone has a chance to speak. Include notes in chat etc..
 
## Which data sets would be useful for this project?

Nicolas L
 - Copernicus program; consistent dataset.
 - Sentinal 1 day and night radar. Same configurations, nice time series analysis. > 10m.
 - Sentinal 2 camera, and programatic acquistion etc. Monitor length, free on multiple products. 10m.
 - Very easy to access, with processing also available online.
 
Cooper E
 - Lots of data online listed on their website. Mainly use sentinal 1 as it can see through clouds etc.
 - GEDI - Lidar based data from ISS.

Kyle Story
 - Sentinal 1/ Sentinal 2 (2015)
 - Landsats allow longer time history than that.
 - Contextual datasets, with different ammounts of time.
 - Different layers of datasets etc.
 
Marc Paganini
 - Sentinal 2 -- 20km from coastline. 
 - Europe has ambition to look at protecting 20% of coastline.
 - High res sattelites. Limited budget. Look at small features, maybe for downscaling Sentinal?
 - Few global scale projects.
 - Copernicus services. Pan-European level. 
 - Land monitoring services: 
   - Global, 
   - Pan-European,
   - Local.
 - Exposure datasets - various population datasets might be helpful.

Steven Briggs
 - Data can be anywhere (no restrictions)
 
Tom Dowling 
 - Look at thermal data from Sentinal 3 etc. ENVI. Draw diversity measures from that.
 - All parts of the EM spectrum could be useful, and the more novel could be the most productive.
 - Have to make all information actionable. Monitor for deforestation. Global Forest Watch. How does data flow?

## What big problems are there in AI4EO

TD 
 - Fragmentation 
   - small areas not sustainable for organisms etc.
   - monitoring would be v. useful.

SB 
 - Fractral structure critically important for biodiversity. 

Luca
 - Project about vegation index about fragmentation.
 - Predicting impact of the development of urban areas.
 - Use lots of old non-AI techniques.
 - Species distributions etc.
 - Improve the distribution of species measurements?

SB 
 - Landcover and topography might be useful.
 - Surface temperature, Koppen climate zone.
 - Driving factors almost endless, therefore AI is a good way forward.
 - Extreme multivariate, very context dependent.

TD 
 - Validation will be v. important especiallly at the end.

## Arduin Findeis: Who would be interested in this kind of data?

TD 
 - National governments. E.g. Chernobyl.
 - Drying out of wetland forest --> worse or better?
 - Analysis of the impact of a project on biodiversity.

SB 
 - Required by international law (e.g. Paris agreement)
 - SDGs -- development goals.
 - Environmental analysis.
 
## SM: Which tools are in use, and what questions can already be answered by them?

MP 
 - Different tools are available in the community
 - U. of Wolfsburg have very nice book. In R?
 - Martin Wegman - Biodiversity tools using species modelling using EO.
 - New set of ambitions come in this year.
 - Vulnerability of the communities to climate change.
 - Decade will involve a lot of new restoration efforts.
 - Look at drivers of changes and classify them. [5]
    - Climate Change.
    - ?
    - Alien Species.
    - Exploitation of resources.
 - Nature based solutions. Greening of cities.
 - Ecosystem accounting - new standard next year. UN, then Eurostat.
 - Ecosystem monitoring and services.

SB 
 - Ecosystem migrations, e.g. butterflys etc.

MP 
 - Phenology v. important.

SB
 - Please talk about EBVs.

MP 
 - EBVs: essential biodiversity variables.
 - Which ones are essential? Currently unclear in some ways. Lead at Geo-BON.
 
 <https://geobon.org/essential-biodiversity-variables-2020-initiative-ebv2020-for-post-2020-global-biodiversity-conservation/>
 
 - Stucture and function, and community compesition.
 - Species modelling etc. using EO.
 - EBV engines.

  
## Zoom Messages:

Standard publicly-available datasets available through the Descartes Labs data platform: <https://www.descarteslabs.com/standard-data-products/>

Another modelling effort, at the ecosystem level that is similar to what Marc is talking about That we have used in past: <https://invest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>
